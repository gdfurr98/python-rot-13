# python-rot-13
Old FCC Challenge rewritten in Python from Javascript
To say that it was rewritten is slightly inaccurate. It wasn't just rewritten, it was reworked so that it took the input recieved in the console and wrote it to a text document.
Furthermore, there is functionality to decode as well, which I put in for the sake of it.
